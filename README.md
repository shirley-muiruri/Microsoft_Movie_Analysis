# Microsoft_Movie_Analysis

Author: Shirley Muiruri

# Overview

This project analyzes the needs of Microsoft, a company primarily involved in creating computer software and hardware. Microsoft, as a way to continue growing, has decided to venture into the movie industry. Analysis of other movie platforms is necessary to determine the best path for the company to take by analyzing ratings, number of votes, genres and runtimes.

# Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they do not know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. 

# Data

Microsoft is looking to enter the movie industry and needs to understand what types of films are currently successful at the box office. The loaded datasets (from IMDb and Box Office Mojo) contain information about movie ratings, basic movie details (like title, year, genre, and runtime), and movie gross earnings (domestic and foreign).

# Methods

The project uses exploratory data analysis to analyze the relationship between data items. This provides a useful overview of the movie industry to identify what type of films are worth filming.

# Results

   Domestic gross is highly right-skewed. This indicates that a large number of movies have relatively low domestic gross earnings, while a small number of outlier movies have very high domestic gross earnings.
   
   Foreign gross is also highly right-skewed. This shows that many movies have lower foreign earnings, and a few movies have exceptionally high foreign gross earnings.
   
  Average rating and runtime show no strong linear correlation with domestic or foreign gross.

The number of movies released generally increased from 2010 to a peak in 2015.
After 2015, there appears to be a decline in the number of movie releases each year, with a significant drop in 2019. Many factors could have led to the decline in movie releases; therefore, it is safe to deduce that Microsoft should exercise caution when deciding what movies to film.

# Conclusions
This analysis leads to three recommendations that Microsoft should take when deciding what type of films to create.

* Prioritize High-Grossing Genres: Focus on producing films in genres that have shown high average domestic and foreign gross earnings. The analysis indicates that Sci-Fi, Adventure, and Animation are strong contenders for high box office returns.

* Consider Audience Engagement: Genres with a high average number of votes, such as Sci-Fi, Adventure, and Action, indicate strong audience interest and engagement. Producing films in these genres could help build a dedicated audience base for the new studio.

* Balance Critical Acclaim and Commercial Appeal: While high ratings are desirable, the analysis shows a very weak correlation between average rating and gross earnings. Microsoft should aim for a balance, considering both critical reception (potentially targeting genres like Documentary, News, and Biography for critical acclaim) and the commercial viability of genres with high box office potential.


# Next Steps
* Further Investigate Successful Films within Promising Genres: Look deeper into the characteristics of successful films within the recommended genres (Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation, Action). Analyze factors like specific sub-genres, production budgets, release strategies, and target audiences to gain more insight into what makes these films perform well.

* Explore the Impact of Runtime: While the scatter plots didn't show a strong linear relationship between runtime and gross, further analysis could explore optimal runtime ranges within successful genres.

By considering these recommendations and continuing to analyze market trends and audience preferences, Microsoft's new movie studio can make informed decisions to increase its chances of success in the competitive film industry.
